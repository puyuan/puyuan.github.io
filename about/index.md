Hi, I am Paul Yuan, a software engineer interested in data analytics, and building scalable web services. 

Back in the days, I worked on full-stack web applications for a deep web search company. 
Later, I moved to enterprise software, focusing on business analytics.
Most recently, I joined a cloud gaming company, which I wrote some of the important Java web services. I switched
gear a little to focus on analytics, which I enjoyed greatly. 

I started out as a frontend person and moved to the backend. Technology is always changing, so I am always eager to learn and refine my craft. Along the way, I find refactoring, testing, communication as an important skill to master. Great software cannot be built alone, without proper maintenance. 

I find constant joy in building and creating new things.
